; an enduser global overview of changes

=== build 347 ===

Correct a calculation error during block splitting.

=== build 346 ===

Add "Server:" header to all HTTP responses including proxy version.

Refine enforced rc5-72 block size ranges to allow CUDA/PS3/STREAM
platforms to have higher limits than others.  Disable large block
sizes to older proxies and clients that do not support it.

Allow blocksize used in proxy requests to upstream be configured.

Add logic to not distribute OGR-NG blocks to clients earlier than
build 509 or proxies earlier than build 346 once OGR-27 begins.

=== build 345 ===

not released

=== build 344 ===

Add support for larger block sizes in rc5-72 (#3918)

keymaster: allow ircmonitor settings to be overriden in ini file.

keymaster: fix ogr recycle delay logic to avoid excessive waiting
after recycling a short stubspace.

=== build 343 ===

First version to support [ogrng] project.

Automatic buffer size calculation works for rc5-72

"connectperiod"/"statusperiod" works correctly for all projects

=== build 341 ===

First version to support [ogrp2] project.  This version will only connect
to upstream servers of at least build 341.

=== build 335 ===

OGR is no longer supported for clients below v2.8015.469 anymore.

"[ports]/timeout" sets maximum idle time for client connections (#2971)

perproxy: fix slow uplink connections for rc5-72 and ogr contents (#2951)

=== build 334 ===

internal cleanup, no user-visible changes.

=== build 333 ===

if local DNS is not available, use remote resolving for SOCKS5 proxy

disallow *.v27.distributed.net as upstream keyserver address.

enforce that the [rc5-72] and [ogr] sections exist in the ini file. 

keymaster: track fullserver dns zones independently in XML proxyinfo
for easier processing with XSL.

when accepting new client connections and maximum concurrent connection
limit has been reached, only disconnect the oldest connection if it
has been idle at least 10 seconds.

clarify up some error messages.

clean up manual html slightly.

=== build 332 ===

fullserver/proxyper: fix regression in false RC5-64 project status
transmission for buggy clients.

fullserver/proxyper: fix average rate computation for RC5-72.


=== build 331 ===

remove des and csc project support from build.

rename rc5 project text and source files to more explicitly state
rc5-64.

add rc5-72 project support.  ini file section name is [rc5-72] for
consistency with the client.

add new v2.90xx client support (with core number reporting).

lots of code formatting cleanup and doxygen comments added.

enforce minimum upstream server build of 330.

proxyper: add OS/2 \\pipe\proxyper signal support

convert manual to html format for easier reading.


=== build 325b (internal release only) ===

fullserver: add workaround to send false RC5-64 project status and
fake blocks to buggy v2.8010 clients.


=== build 325 (internal release only) ===

fullserver: alter block splitting order algorithm to reduce
fragmentation slightly.

fullserver/proxyper: reinstate dupe-checking and dupe-logging for
RC5-64 using completely rewritten STL implementation.

fullserver: alter network flushing agressiveness for upstream server
traffic.

keymaster: add extra disk log error checking and initiate shutdown on
disk failure.

keymaster: multithreaded project eating and generation support and
significant thread-safety added everywhere.  now each project on the
keymaster utilizes a separate thread for eating and generating (rather
than one thread that shared the two activities), since the two
activities take different amounts of time.

keymaster: add XML-based proxyinfo data publication.

keymaster: fix rare memory access-violation when generating the last
block within a subspace, which tried to span beyond the limit.

code cleanup, move many global settings into ProxyGlobals structure,
move iniread into iniclass, util into dctiutil, add threading
abstraction module.


=== build 321 (internal release only) ===

fullserver and keymaster only:  replace DCTI_FileBuffer (filebuff.cpp)
with CircularBuffer (circbuff.cpp) implementation.  proxyper still
uses filebuff.

change RC5-64 and OGR file buffer identifier constants to prevent
version conflicts.



=== build 319c (12 Sept 2000) ===

win32 version can now be signalled to flush, quit, or reload its
configuration by an external program that opens and signals events
named "ProxyperConnectEvent", "ProxyperShutdownEvent", or 
"ProxyperReloadEvent" respectively. [319b fixed permission problem
when the proxy is running as a service on NT/Win2k]

fixed regression bug introduced in 316 that prevented reload signals
from properly reloading all contest configuration options.

optimal block selection algorithm on personal proxy modified to
no longer search the entire in-buff for a block large enough when an
incoming client requests a block.  Now only searches the first 32
blocks for a work unit large enough.

participation in contests can now be entirely disabled by setting
the "contestclosed" entry within your INI to a negative value.

[keyserver]/serveridletimeout added to allow persistent server
connections to time out more rapidly, particularly for people on ISDN
or dialup connections.

minimum blocksize enforcement code removed from personal proxy builds,
only fullserver enforces minimum sizes now.


=== build 318 (14 Jul 2000) ===

experimental minimum blocksize enforcement code added to fullserver
and personal.


=== build 317 (not publicly released) ===

contest OGR is reported as always being closed and out of blocks to
clients earlier than 2.8009, since they are not supported for OGR.

[console]/logfilepurgeage and contest/logfilepurgeage support added.
automatically keeps only the "n" most recent log files after rotating,
and automatically deletes older ones.


=== build 316 (not publicly released) ===

changed winnt service startup dependence from NetworkProvider to
simply Tcpip.  You need to -uninstall and -install again to get
updated service dependencies.

on UNIX, sending SIGUSR1 will force the proxy into offline mode
(regardless of what is in the ini file), and SIGUSR2 will return
it to whatever mode is specified in the ini.  This can be used
with cron scripting to create "no connection" time periods.

there have again been major rewrites and reorganization to the proxy
codebase to enable easier support for future contests that are not
crypto-key based in nature.

proxy status lines are now supressed for closed contests.

corrected period at which the proxy buffer files are rewritten.
They were being incorrectly rewritten on every cycle, instead of
once per workperiod, which would result in poor performance.

ogr contest now reports more accurate node speeds, since the sliding
average now uses the full nodecount, instead of just the upper 32-bits.

changed the "tot=" portion of the ogr status line to report total
stubs (instead of just the upper 32-bits of total nodes) that have
been received.

the frequency at which the proxy buffers are rewritten to disk can now
be independently controlled with [misc]/periodicperiod (it was
previously simultaneously done at the same interval as
[misc]/statusperiod).


=== build 315 (not publicly released) ===

corrected logging of the scheduledupdatetime when a new time is first
received from the upstream keyserver.

corrected improper upstream transmission of OGR stubs with invalid
stub counts, which could cause it to never upload some blocks under
certain conditions.


=== build 314 (14 Feb 2000) ===

corrected 64-bit sign-extension errors when logging keyblocks on
64-bit (ie: Alpha) platforms.


=== build 313 (26 Jan 2000) ===

timestamp format can now be adjusted via ini file.

log formatting for ogr stub/nodes changed to accomodate greater size.


=== build 312 (13 Jan 2000) ===

number of stubs sent/received during a server connection are now
properly tracked and logged.  

win32 console titlebar now only includes open contests.

changed logcompressor invocation to use rfork() on freebsd, and vfork()
on other platforms.  rfork() allows us to explicitly disable filehandle
inheritance to children processes.

Corrected bug in cyp's rewrite of netio_resolve that prevented
detection of NULL return values from gethostbyname (failed to
resolve), which usually led the caller to believe that it was
successfully able to resolve 255.255.255.255

fixed bug that would cause a personal proxy compiled
without lurk support to connect to the server on threshold surpassment
even in offline mode.

changed messages to display "(thresholds exceeded)" instead of
"(connect period elapsed)"


=== build 311 (8 Nov 1999) ===

Official release for CSC contest support.  All proxies/servers must be
updated to 311+ to support CSC, otherwise the version information will be
lost during retransmission upstream (311 now removes the version check).

sigio optimizations on freebsd now disabled, since it was found to
cause network stalling.

average rate computation for ogr added.  Contest rate summaries now can
include customized rate labels.  OGR displays units as "Mnodes/sec"

discarded client subbuild version check.

if pkt->id is 'rc5@distributed.net' log it to logfile (and only there) as ""
for perproxy logs: if id==rc5@distributed.net then id=nobody@[ipaddress].


=== build 309 (15 Jul 1999) ===

contest open and closure enhanced on master to not allow reopening
without restart.  also eliminated need for full generator initialization
on rc5/des/ogr/csc if the contest is closed.

preliminary csc and ogr contest support standard.


=== build 308 (2 Jun 1999) ===

fixed interop problem between 306+ SPARC proxies and non-SPARC 443+
clients.

fixed rare silent exit problem with all unix platforms except Linux
triggered by broken pipe on server connection.

pidfile is now deleted on proper proxy shutdown.

enhancement of network data decoding loop to reduce amount of wasted
cpu time while waiting for full network packets to be received.

improved idle connection detection to locate additional cases of
open idle network connections, and infinite buffer filling.

when the ignore/allow host rulesets are reloaded, currently established
client connections are immediately reevaluated and disconnected on match.

connection establishment is now non-blocking again to allow connects
to occur without interrupting normal operations of the main loop.



=== build 307 ===:

added expertmode ([rc564]/expertmode) to bypass the automatic treshold 
adjustments

connection keep-alive header (added in 306) no longer transmitted,
only proxy-connection keep-alive, on upstream server connections.

when responding to an incoming client, connection keep-alive header
only sent to a client if it requested a keep-alive.

reduced cpu usage of extended xfd select operations, including logic
to reduce number of subselect statements needed, especially on win32.


	
=== build 306 ===:

new "generic proxy" support added as new firewall connection method.

proxy tries harder to really hand out the requested blocksize

complete ACL with [ignoredip] AND [allowedip] section and a
allowincoming parameter to totally block incoming traffic.

removed random block generation and randomprefix tracking.  random
generation should now only be done by clients when necessary.

dynamically adjusting maxready buffer limits based on keyrate-averages

sliding keyrate average window now defaults to one day with more
freedom to adjust these values.

dupechecking on fullservers and personalproxies

fullservers check in every connectperiod even if there's now work

outgoing connection errors, such as "connection refused", are
detected properly now.

personal proxy buffers now use a variant of the original (pre300) queues
for storing blocks and additionally attempts to frequently update their
contents back to disk.

http tunnelling support improved to support proxies that do not maintain
persistent socket connections.

ogr project support added.

logcompressor support reenabled, fork/zombie problems corrected.

problems with selecting too many sockets on win32 eliminated.

fullserver buffers opened in exclusive mode. improved fullserver repair
and unlock. autorepair now invoked after any significant corruption
detection, instead of just when the basic consistency checks fail.
buffer cycle checking added.

problems with not being able to resolve specified hostnames resolved and
properly detected as failures.

improved tolerances of time changes of the local machine.

syncronized many more common files with those of client, including
iniread, cputypes, win32 lurk, and win32 service functionality.

possible problems with stagnant server or client connections with null
socket handles not getting properly closed by proxy resolved.

eliminated crash if a pidfile was specified but it could not be opened
or insufficient file permissions existed to write to it.

=== build 305 ===:

(development version only)


=== build 304 ===:

status period option added to control period between periodic contest
reports.

total block counts per contest added to periodic contest reports.

logverbosity now accepts a list of keywords.

some console log messages slightly modified, others added.


=== build 303 ===:

temporarily disabled logcompressor until buffer corruption can be
completely resolved. 

buffers will autorepair when validation fails. 

updated documentation and sample ini files to more closely reflect
available options. 

proxy no longer attempts to window as many block requests if the
additional needed number is low. 

pidfile now contains correct pid when -detach is used. 

major rework of DES generation code to accomodate EFF macrospace
distribution. 

corrected some logging aspects on master. 

DES blocks from closed contests are now discarded. 


=== build 302 ===:

nt service installation should work now blocks should be requested up to
maxready now, connections still triggered by minready. 

documentation for ignoredip section updated. 

no longer attempts to request des blocks when des is closed. -repair and
-unlock should no longer hang if your buffers have loops in them
anymore. 

lots of possibly problems that could lead to buffer corruption havebeen
fixed. 

contest start times that have already passed are no longer given to clients
when they connect. 

console output now indicates which contest when blocks are requested,
received, delivered, etc. 

proxy should no longer request infinitely many blocks when your buffer
thresholds are too low. 

keyserver/bindip now actually works. 

many issues that could cause invalid size blocks to be saved or given to
clients have also been addressed. 


=== build 301 ===:

minor bugfixes.


=== build 300 ===:

complete rewrite
